Clocks
======

Requirements
------------

- GTK+ 3.x with introspection support
- Python


Installing
----------
 - It is not mandatory to install, you can run the program from the source directory
 - If you want to install, run ./setup.py install (if you want you can specify an
   installation prefix, e.g. ./setup.py install --prefix=/opt/gnome


Running
-------

 - To run the program from the source directory, simply use ./gnome-clocks
 - If you installed the program in a custom prefix, you will need to export
   the following environment variables:

export GNOME_CLOCKS_IMAGE_PATH=/opt/gnome/share/gnome-clocks
export GNOME_CLOCKS_DATA_PATH=/opt/gnome/share/gnome-clocks
export GNOME_CLOCKS_LOCALE_PATH=/opt/gnome/share/locale

   where "/opt/gnome" is the installation prefix. If you are using jhbuild
   you can add the following lines to your .jhbuildrc file:

os.environ['GNOME_CLOCKS_DATA_PATH'] = '/opt/gnome/share/gnome-clocks'
os.environ['GNOME_CLOCKS_IMAGE_PATH'] = '/opt/gnome/share/gnome-clocks'
os.environ['GNOME_CLOCKS_LOCALE_PATH'] = '/opt/gnome/share/locale'
